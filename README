Pragha is a Lightweight Music Player for GNU/Linux, based on Gtk, sqlite, and
completely written in C, constructed to be fast, light, and simultaneously
tries to be complete without obstructing the daily work. ;)

A tiny history of the project.?
Consonance, An excellent player emerged in the archlinux forums, was
discontinued. The author, Sacamano said in his blog:
 "Which doesn't mean that it won't be maintained. I would still be fixing bugs,
  but major feature additions are not in the pipeline, because I have completed
  all that I wanted to see in Consonance. It has been a fun project. :)"

Well.. Dissonance is the project to continue developing Consonance, and its
result is Pragha Music Player. A New reproducer of music.. ;)
