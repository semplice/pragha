OVERVIEW:

Here is a brief description of how to compile Pragha to Windows using MinGW
from an Fedora host system. Note that these were my tests. Surely there are
better ways of doing it. In any case send me a mail.

Install deps:
	# sudo yum install mingw32-gcc mingw32-gtk3 mingw32-gstreamer1 \
	mingw32-gstreamer1-plugins-base mingw32-sqlite mingw32-taglib

Prepare the build:
	# git clone https://github.com/matiasdelellis/pragha.git PraghaWin32
	# cd PraghaWin32
	# ./autogen.sh --host=i586-mingw32msvc --enable-debug
	# mingw32-configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --enable-debug

Build and install:
	# make -j5
	# sudo make install

How to test:
	# sudo yum install wine
	# wine /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/pragha.exe

It work properly?
	Probably not, due to lack the support to directsound, and all proprietary
	codecs. You need install a complete version of Gstreamer SDK
